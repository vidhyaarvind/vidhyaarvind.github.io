I am a Staff software engineer and founding member of Netflixâ€™s data abstraction platform, which supports common patterns including KeyValue, Tree, TimeSeries, Table Metadata, and more. I love learning, debugging, scaling systems, and solving hard problems. I currently spends most of her time providing scalable abstractions for thousands of developers at Netflix. 

You can find links to some of my [projects](https://github.com/vidhyaarvind) and [talks](/talks/)
