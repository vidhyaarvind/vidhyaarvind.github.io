At Netflix, Data abstraction plays a pivotal role in hosting 100s of use cases that scale, they are widely adopted and depended on by mission-critical systems. In this talk, I show how to design reliable APIs and layout data for Key-Value services for petabyte-scale datasets. Key-value service uses a control plane and data plane to abstract the data, uses some novel techniques to reliably store and safely scale the service to 100s of instances.
