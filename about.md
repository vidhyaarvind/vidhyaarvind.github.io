## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

<img src="/assets/profile_picture.jpeg" />


I am a Staff software engineer and founding member of Netflixâ€™s data abstraction platform, which supports common patterns including KeyValue, Tree, TimeSeries, Table Metadata, and more. I love learning, debugging, scaling systems, and solving hard problems. I currently spend most of my time providing scalable abstractions for thousands of developers at Netflix.
